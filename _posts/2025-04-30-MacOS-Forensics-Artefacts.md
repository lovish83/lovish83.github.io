In this walkthrough, we'll focus on forensic artefacts in macOS, their locations, and how they aid in investigations.

#### Learning Objectives  
- Identify forensic artefacts in macOS.  
- Locate these artefacts.  
- Understand their role in investigations.

#### Prerequisites  
Complete [macOS Forensics: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/macosforensicsbasics) and have a basic knowledge of Linux/Unix command line. This room involves working with live systems and macOS disk images in a Linux environment.

>**All answers have been provided along with the `commands` needed to obtain the answers.**
